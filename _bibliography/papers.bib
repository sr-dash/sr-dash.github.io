  title={Ensemble Kalman Filter Data Assimilation into the Surface Flux Transport Model to Infer Surface Flows: An Observing System Simulation Experiment},
  author={Soumyaranjan Dash, and Marc L. DeRosa, and Mausumi Dikpati, and Xudong Sun, and Sushant S. Mahajan, and Yang Liu, and J. Todd Hoeksema},
  abstract={Knowledge of the global magnetic field distribution and its evolution on the Sun's surface is crucial for modeling the coronal magnetic field, 
understanding the solar wind dynamics, computing the heliospheric open flux distribution, and predicting the solar cycle strength. 
As the far side of the Sun cannot be observed directly and high-latitude observations always suffer from projection effects, 
we often rely on surface flux transport (SFT) simulations to model the long-term global magnetic field distribution. 
Meridional circulation, the large-scale north–south component of the surface flow profile, is one of the key components 
of the SFT simulation that requires further constraints near high latitudes. Prediction of the photospheric magnetic field distribution 
requires knowledge of the flow profile in the future, which demands reconstruction of that same flow at the current time so that it can be estimated 
at a later time. By performing Observing System Simulation Experiments, we demonstrate how the ensemble Kalman filter technique, when used with an SFT model, 
can be utilized to make "posterior" estimates of flow profiles into the future that can be used to drive the model forward to forecast the photospheric 
magnetic field distribution.},

  title={Long-term forcing of the Sun's coronal field, open flux, and cosmic ray modulation potential during grand minima, maxima, and regular activity phases by the solar dynamo mechanism},
  author={Soumyaranjan Dash, and Dibyendu Nandy, and Ilya Usoskin},
  abstract={Magnetic fields generated in the Sun's interior by the dynamo mechanism drive solar activity over a range of time-scales. 
  Direct sunspot observations exist for a few centuries; reconstructed variations based on cosmogenic isotopes in the solar open flux 
  and cosmic ray flux exist over thousands of years. While such reconstructions indicate the presence of extreme solar activity fluctuations in the past, 
  causal links between millennia scale dynamo activity, consequent coronal field, solar wind, open flux and cosmic ray flux variations remain elusive; a lack of 
  coronal field observations compounds this issue. By utilizing a stochastically forced solar dynamo model and potential field source surface extrapolation, we 
  perform long-term simulations to illuminate how dynamo generated magnetic fields govern the structure of the solar corona and the state of the heliosphere -- as 
  indicated by variations in the open flux and cosmic ray modulation potential. We establish differences in the nature of the large-scale structuring of the solar corona 
  during grand maximum, minimum, and regular solar activity phases and simulate how the open flux and cosmic ray modulation potential vary across these different phases of 
  activity. We demonstrate that the power spectrum of simulated and observationally reconstructed solar open flux time series are consistent with each other. 
  Our study provides the theoretical foundation for interpreting long-term solar cycle variations inferred from cosmogenic isotope based reconstructions and establishes 
  causality between solar internal variations to the forcing of the state of the heliosphere.},

  title={Causality in heliophysics: magnetic fields as a bridge between the Sun's interior and the Earth's space environment},

  abstract={Our host star, the Sun, is a middle-aged main sequence G type star whose activity varies. These variations are primarily governed by 
  solar magnetic fields which are produced in the Sun's interior via a magnetohydrodynamic dynamo mechanism. Solar activity manifests across different 
  timescales, spanning transient phenomena such as flares, energetic particle events and coronal mass ejections to short to long-term modulation of solar irradiance, 
  plasma winds, open flux and cosmic ray flux in the heliosphere. Collectively, these phenomena define space weather and space climate, which impact the state of 
  the near-Earth space environment, the Earth's magnetosphere, atmosphere and our space-reliant technologies. Understanding physical processes that are at the 
  heart of solar variability and which causally connect the Sun-Earth system is therefore of immense importance to humanity. Such understanding leads to 
  predictions of the impact of solar activity on our planet and provides a window to explore the plasma universe and other star-planet systems, including 
  assessing the habitability of (exo)planets. In this review, based on our research on the solar-terrestrial system and extant scientific literature, 
  we illuminate processes related to the genesis of solar magnetic fields in the Sun’s interior, their emergence and evolution, their manifestation 
  as solar eruptive events, and their eventual impact on the geospace environment mediated via solar winds and storms. We focus on few phenomena 
  that establish causal connections and demonstrate how our current understanding can lead to development of predictive capabilities encompassing 
  the domain of heliophysics.},

  title={Solar evolution and extrema: current state of understanding of long-term solar variability and its planetary impacts},
  author={Dibyendu Nandy, and Petrus C. H. Martens, and Vladimir Obridko, and Soumyaranjan Dash and Katya Georgieva},
  abstract={The activity of stars such as the Sun varies over timescales ranging from the very short to the very long—stellar and planetary evolutionary timescales. Experience from our solar 
  system indicates that short-term, transient events such as stellar flares and coronal mass ejections create hazardous space environmental conditions that impact Earth-orbiting satellites and 
  planetary atmospheres. Extreme events such as stellar superflares may play a role in atmospheric mass loss and create conditions unsuitable for life. Slower, long-term evolutions of the activity 
  of Sun-like stars over millennia to billions of years result in variations in stellar wind properties, radiation flux, cosmic ray flux, and frequency of magnetic storms. This coupled evolution of 
  star-planet systems eventually determines planetary and exoplanetary habitability. The Solar Evolution and Extrema (SEE) initiative of the Variability of the Sun and Its Terrestrial Impact (VarSITI) 
  program of the Scientific Committee on Solar-Terrestrial Physics (SCOSTEP) aimed to facilitate and build capacity in this interdisciplinary subject of broad interest in astronomy and astrophysics. 
  In this review, we highlight progress in the major themes that were the focus of this interdisciplinary program, namely, reconstructing and understanding past solar activity including grand minima 
  and maxima, facilitating physical dynamo-model-based predictions of future solar activity, understanding the evolution of solar activity over Earth's history including the faint young Sun paradox, 
  and exploring solar-stellar connections with the goal of illuminating the extreme range of activity that our parent star—the Sun—may have displayed in the past, or may be capable of unleashing in the future.},

  title={Flux Erosion of Magnetic Clouds by Reconnection With the Sun's Open Flux},
  author={Sanchita Pal, and Soumyaranjan Dash, and Dibyendu Nandy},
  abstract={Magnetic clouds (MCs) are flux rope magnetic structures forming a subset of 
  solar coronal mass ejections, which have significant space weather impacts. The geoeffectiveness 
  of MCs depends on their properties, which evolve during their interplanetary passage. Based on 
  an analysis of observations spanning two solar cycles, we establish that MCs interacting with the 
  ambient solar wind magnetic field (i.e., heliospheric open flux) lose a substantial amount of their 
  initial magnetic flux via magnetic reconnection, which, in some cases, reduce their geoeffectiveness. 
  We find a linear correlation between the eroded flux of MCs and solar open flux which is consistent with 
  the scenario that MC erosion is mediated via the local heliospheric magnetic field draping around an MC during 
  its interplanetary propagation. The solar open flux is governed by the sunspot cycle. This work therefore uncovers a 
  hitherto unknown pathway for solar cycle modulation of the properties of MCs.},

  author={Soumyaranjan Dash, and Prantika Bhowmik, and BS Athira, and Nirmalya Ghosh, and Dibyendu Nandy},
  abstract={On 2019 July 2 a total solar eclipse—visible across parts of the Southern Pacific Ocean,

  However, coronal magnetic field measurements remain an outstanding challenge. Coronal magnetic field models serve an 
  important purpose in this context. Earlier work has demonstrated that the large-scale coronal structure is governed by 
  surface flux evolution and memory buildup, which allows for its prediction on solar rotational timescales. Utilizing this
