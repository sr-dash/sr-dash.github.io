I am Soumyaranjan Dash, a solar physicist currently working as a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute for Astronomy (IFA), University of Hawaii. My research focuses on studying generation and evolution of solar magnetic fields and their far-reaching impacts on the heliosphere with observational data driven numerical models. With a strong foundation in numerical modeling, observational data analysis, and advanced technique development, I aim to answer pressing questions about the Sun’s magnetic dynamics and its influence on space weather phenomena. My current projects explore areas such as the evolution of the solar magnetic field, surface flux transport process, and coronal magnetic field modelling and observations. I earned my PhD at [CESSI](http://www.cessi.in/), [IISER Kolkata](http://www.iiserkol.ac.in/), under the mentorship of Prof. Dibyendu Nandy, where I developed novel approaches to understanding the Sun. Before that, I completed my Master’s degree in Theoretical Physics at the Central University of Himachal Pradesh.

I come from Odisha, India, a state celebrated for its rich cultural diversity and heritage. When I’m not immersed in solar physics, I enjoy expressing my creativity through photography and cooking, and I love traveling to discover new places and experiences.
