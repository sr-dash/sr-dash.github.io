I primarily use data from DKIST’s CryoNIRSP instrument, along with other observational sources, to study the magnetic structure and dynamics of the solar corona. These direct measurements are essential for revealing how magnetic fields shape coronal activity and influence the broader heliosphere. By combining high-resolution observations with modeling, I aim to improve our understanding of solar magnetic connectivity and its impact on space weather, contributing to better forecasting and deeper insight into the Sun’s role in the solar system.","highlights":["Solar Physics","Magnetic Fields","Numerical Simulations","Observational Data Analysis","Scientific Writing"]},{"name":"Institute for Astronomy, University of Hawaii","position":"Solar Physics Postdoctoral Fellow","url":"https://people.ifa.hawaii.edu/postdocs/bio/soumyaranjan-dash/","startDate":"2023-03-21","endDate":"2025-06-15","summary":"Conducting research on the origin and dynamics of solar magnetic fields using numerical simulations and observational data analysis.
